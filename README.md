# RealtimeDatabaseFaceDetectionAttendanceSystem-LAMBDA

In the RealtimeDatabaseFaceDetectionAttendanceSystem-LAMBDA project, Python is used to develop the facial recognition algorithms and to interact with the camera or other input devices that capture images of individuals. Firebase, on the other hand, is used as a cloud-based backend to store and manage the attendance data.

The use of Firebase allows for real-time synchronization and data management across multiple devices or locations, making it a convenient choice for a live attendance tracking system. Additionally, Firebase offers built-in authentication and security features, which can help ensure that the attendance data is secure and only accessible to authorized users.
